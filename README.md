# eco-collect-releases
Eco Collect is a community waste reporting app built with React Native and Supabase. Users report illegal dumping, others confirm it, and admins approve verified reports into cleanup jobs. It includes role-based access (customer, collector, admin), confirmation safeguards, and structured job creation to support transparent local waste management.
